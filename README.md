- This code repository is associated with our paper titled as "FaceFetch: an efficient and scalable face-retrieval System that uses your visual memory"
which was presented as IEEE BigMultimedia 2020 (BigMM 2020) conference in Singapore. 

- This is a Face-retrieval system that relies only on the slight impressions of the target face the person is searching for in a database of faces. Please read the  freely available preprint of the paper (.pdf) which is in the current folder for details on the proposed system.

- The instruction to run the FaceFetch webapp is written in the READMe file in the <i>face-fetch/app/</i> folder.
